# Python-Exploring-User-Generated-Events
Wrangling user generated event data from Kaggle's 2019 Data Science Bowl with Python and Pandas.   Code demonstrates:
* How Python's <code class="language-Python">def<code> can make code easier to comprehend
* How Python's <code class="language-Python">%%time<code> can help uncover performance bottlenecks
* How Python's <code class="language-Python">json module<code> can make parsing JSON data easier
* How Pandas can be used to summarize events by user when faced with a log-style data file
